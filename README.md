# Hack The Change 2021 - Group 14

This repository includes the code I made for my group, as well as the final presentation.

## The Code

I was in charge of API integration for the project, specifically
* A weather API
* A Google Sheets API
* An Activity Generator API

The API's were all made in python, whereas the rest of the project (not included here) was done mostly in HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

## Awards
This project won a prize for the best use of cloud computing at the Hack The Change hackathon. More on how cloud computing was used for this project can be found in the powerpoint.
